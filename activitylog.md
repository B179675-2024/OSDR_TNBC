# PROJECT ACTIVITY LOG

Author: Gabin Rousseau

This file serves to track my daily activities throughout the MSc project associated with the repository, should be helpful for the dissertation write-up!
The log is arranged in a weekly basis with a list of key goals/achievements when I feel like updating them, followed by daily entries that describe what I did.

## Week 0 | 20/05 - 23/05
Goals: 

- [X] Prepare version-controlled work environment for the project.
 
#### Tuesday 20/05
- Had first meeting with Linus. About proposal: highlighted that some extra explanatory figures adapted from the key references would have been a really positive addition; overall positive.
- Office space: set up a personal user session on a desktop in the Bioinformatics office. However, the desk space itself is used until end of June, is there no free space that will be consistently available, so it is important to make sure I can comfortably work remotely.
- Joined the group GitHub (here).
- Communication: Teams for general use, email for big things that need to be traced.
- Somer _et al._ code: no updates, still trying to get an reply. Assumption to not have access to it at all: the goal will be to start reproducing the method from scratch and attempt to replicate results for simulated data.
- Meetings: sent a regular calendar invite for Tuesdays at 1pm.
- Installed conda on user session (added to PATH), set up a remote connection via SSH (I am using MobaXTerm to do this on my Windows 11 laptop).
- Github: created repository, created fine-grained token (pending), will use it to clone the repository on my session when approved.

#### Wednesday 21/05

- GitHub token approved, repository cloned to the workstation, tested token with first commit.
- Git push with token succesfull, then tested pulling.
- Pull succesfull, version-control environment in place and ready for use.
